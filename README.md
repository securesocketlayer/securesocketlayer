Hi there! I am the Secure Socket Layer (SSL), a cryptographic protocol designed to provide secure communication over the internet. My main job is to encrypt the data exchanged between a client (like your web browser) and a server, ensuring that sensitive information like passwords, credit card details, and personal data stays private and protected from hackers. Over time, I've evolved into Transport Layer Security (TLS), but Iâ€™m still commonly referred to as SSL. The internet relies on me heavily to maintain data integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality. In fact, many older devices and systems have become obsolete because they can't support modern SSL/TLS protocols, leaving them vulnerable to security risks.
